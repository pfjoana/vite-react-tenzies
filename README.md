# Tenzies Game

This project is a class project built with React on Vite to implement a digital version of the Tenzies game.

## Overview
The goal of the Tenzies game is to roll the dice until all the numbers on the dice are the same. Each die can be locked, and only the unlocked dice are rolled when the roll button is clicked. The game continues until all the dice are locked and display the same number, indicating that the game is finished. Additionally, a confetti effect is displayed on the screen to celebrate the completion of the game.

## Features
- Roll the dice: Click the roll button to roll all unlocked dice.
- Lock dice: Click on individual dice to lock them and prevent them from rolling.
- Game completion: When all dice are locked and display the same number, the game is finished.
- Confetti effect: Upon completion of the game, a confetti effect is displayed on the screen.
